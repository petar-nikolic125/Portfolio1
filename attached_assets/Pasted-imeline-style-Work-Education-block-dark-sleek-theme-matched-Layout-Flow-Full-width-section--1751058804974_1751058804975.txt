imeline-style Work & Education block — dark, sleek, theme-matched

Layout & Flow
Full-width section immediately after the Hero.

Vertical centre-line (1 px hairline in 8 % white opacity) running down the middle of the section.

Alternating cards on left (Work) and right (Education) of the line, aligned to a 40 px gutter from the centre.

Timeline Entries
Each entry is a rounded card with:

Icon badge

48 px circle, lightly tinted surface, 2 px ivory border, containing the logo or a representative glyph.

Positioned on the centre-line, vertically centred to its card.

Period label

Small-caps, Inter SemiBold, tracked +2 px, 14 px size, above the card.

Faded (40 % ivory) by default, brightens on card hover.

Card content

Title (e.g. “Software Engineer – Freelance”) in 20 px serif, ivory.

Subtitle (impact bullets or role details) in 16 px Inter Regular, soft-gray.

Bullet list for key points (max 3 lines), each bullet animating in with a 150 ms staggered fade-slide from the centre-line.

Hover/motion

On hover, the entire card lifts 4 px (transform: translateY(-4px)) + subtle drop-shadow intensifies.

The centre-line segment near that entry glows briefly (200 ms pulse of ivory at 20 % opacity).

Period label text brightens to full ivory.
