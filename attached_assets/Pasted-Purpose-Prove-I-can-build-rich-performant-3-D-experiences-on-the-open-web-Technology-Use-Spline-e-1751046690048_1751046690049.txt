Purpose
Prove I can build rich, performant 3-D experiences on the open web.

Technology
Use Spline embeds where possible (lighter authoring workflow) and fall back to Three.js for fully bespoke pieces. All 3-D code must live in a lazily-loaded React component so first paint stays snappy on mobile.

A. Hero background accent (subtle)
Scene: slow-orbit wireframe orb or orbital rings behind my name.

Interaction: follows mouse / device tilt with parallax, but never steals focus from text.

Performance guardrails: capped 60 fps, suspend animation when tab is inactive.

B. “3-D Lab” section (wow piece)
Element	Requirement
Viewport	Full-width canvas, 100 vh minus navbar.
Concept	“Pixel Component Craft” factory: mechanical arms grab floating UI components (buttons, cards) and snap them onto a rotating cube that eventually morphs into my logo.
CTA	Floating label “Explore Live Demo →” that opens https://pixel-component-craft.vercel.app/ in new tab.
Controls	Click-and-drag orbit, scroll to zoom, mobile pinch-zoom; hints fade after 3 s.
Audio	Optional low-volume servo hum that auto-mutes on mobile unless user interacts.

C. Project cards → 3-D micro-previews
Replace static thumbnail with looped 3-D sticker: each card has its own mini spline—e.g., a little chart that pulses, a robot arm flipping cards, etc.

Hover / tap expands to larger modal playing the full animation; modal closes on outside click or ESC.

D. “More projects” tile
Tile itself is a miniature voxel room; click causes the room to explode outward and transition to /projects route.

E. Responsiveness & fallback
Desktop: 60 fps target at 1440p.

Mobile: auto-detect perf; reduce particles, half resolution, disable shadows if device has ≤4 GB RAM.

Static poster frame fallback for browsers without WebGL.

F. Accessibility
prefers-reduced-motion disables camera auto-orbit and heavy particle fields.

All 3-D canvases are aria-hidden="true" with descriptive <figcaption> equivalents right after.

Deliverable summary for Loveable
Embed Spline scene behind hero text.

Build “Pixel Component Craft” factory as centrepiece (see link above for live demo).

Swap every project card image for a 3-D micro-preview.

Ensure smooth adaptation from desktop to mobile, with graceful degradation.

No colours, no code — only flawless structure and jaw-dropping 3-D flair.
