Global principles
One long-scroll page that reads like an interactive CV.

Sections appear in logical CV order: Hero → Work/Education → Projects (with filtering) → Skills/Contact.

Animations delivered with plain CSS keyframes plus lightweight TypeScript helpers (intersection-observer, requestAnimationFrame).

Motion respects prefers-reduced-motion; everything degrades to static.

1 Hero (“Petar Nikolić”)
Element	Animation
Name heading	0 → 100 % opacity + 10 px upward slide over 400 ms on load.
Subtitle (“Software Engineer”)	Delayed 100 ms; same slide-in but shorter distance.
Tagline line (“full-stack…”)	Typewriter effect: 30 ms per char, cursor blink stops at end.
Location row & buttons	Fade-in + subtle scale-up (0.96 → 1) chained after tagline completes.
Social icons	Appear one-by-one (stagger 80 ms) with a quick 180° Y-axis flip.

2 Work / Education toggle
Glassy pill slides horizontally; knob travel eased with a spring function ( stiffness = 140, damping = 12 ).

Cards

Enter from left (Work) or right (Education) depending on toggle direction.

Each metric inside the card counts up (data-count attribute → final value) via TS helper.

Vertical accent line draws itself (CSS stroke-dashoffset) during card slide.

3 Projects section (sortable, filterable)
Feature	Motion
Section heading	Same slide-in pattern as Hero for consistency.
Filter chips	On first view: chips cascade downward like falling dominoes (30 ms offset).
Project grid	Masonry grid; items lazy-mount with scale-from-90 % + fade.
Hover / focus	Card lifts 6 px, box-shadow intensifies, internal link icons slide in from the right.
Sorting change	Removed cards zoom-out + fade; new order zoom-in. (Keep duration ≤ 250 ms to feel snappy.)

4 Subtle navigational cues
Scroll hint under Hero: chevron that gently rises 6 px then falls, repeating 3×, then hides.

Progress bar on right edge: width grows with scroll (% of body height) using position:fixed pseudo element and transform:scaleY.

Section snap: use CSS scroll-snap-type:y mandatory; to lock wheel/touch increments to each major block.

5 Skills & Contact footer
Component	Animation
Skills pills	Appear via radial burst from centre of section (keyframe scale 0 → 1).
Contact icons	Idle 80 % opacity; on hover they quick-rotate 20° and return (transform-origin:center bottom).

6 Performance guardrails
All keyframe animations run for ≤ 700 ms; avoid expensive filters.

Trigger animations only when elements are within 80 % of viewport via intersection-observer.

For users with reduced-motion, swap slide/scale for simple fade-ins and disable counters.

7 Copy tweaks
Rename featured card to “Full-Stack Interactive Website Showcase” and label with a small “Website Display” badge.

Place this card as the first item in Projects grid—same size as peers, not full-screen.

Add project descriptions that start with quantifiable impact (“Cut latency 40 %…”, “Achieved 99.9 % SLA…”).

Deliver these pure-CSS/TS animations to keep recruiters hooked while preserving hierarchy and harmony—no 3-D required, still totally overkill.
