1. Kill the auto–scroll hijack
Remove all scroll-snap and mouse-move scroll listeners that jump the viewport.

Let natural smooth scrolling (scroll-behavior: smooth;) handle transitions—no forced snaps or rebound effects.

2. Single-page, CV-style flow
Sequence:

Hero

Work (full-width bullets)

Education (full-width bullets)

Skills

Projects (grid + filters inline)

No “More Projects” button leading elsewhere; everything lives on this one landing page.

3. Work section — five flashy bullets
Use a vertical bullet list with interactive hover highlights (background glow, left-edge accent bar, tiny scale-up). Each item:

“Slick Shopify App” – mobile-first PWA, 4.9★ rating, $120 K+ MRR.

“Ultra-Responsive E-Tail Site” – 98 Lighthouse score on mobile; +25 % CSAT.

“On-Demand Booking Platform” – real-time chat + WebSocket feed, 15 K DAU.

“Interactive Learning Portal” – gamified quizzes, 30 % longer session times.

“Custom CMS Dashboard” – d3.js data viz, 1 M records/sec ingest.

4. Education section — five bullet deep-dive
Also as animated bullets (staggered fade + slide):

OOP Application Suite – JavaFX modules, 95 % test coverage, JUnit.

Kernel Extensions – xv6 shared-memory + custom syscalls, +18 % throughput.

AI in Medicine – CNN melanoma detector (92 % AUC), white-paper PDF link.

Design Patterns Framework – full demo app showcasing Factory, Observer, Strategy, plus interactive UML.

Psychotherapy Scheduler – Enterprise Java MySQL/JDBC, JavaFX UI, ACID bookings at scale.

5. Tone-down the project search UI
Inline search bar above the grid; no slide-over panel.

Simple fade-in/out of filters; collapse extra blank margins.

Keep filter toggles minimal—checkbox + label with micro-hover interactions.

6. “Website Display” card — go full neon
Badge: “Live Site” top-right, pulses on hover.

Hover effect: card border glows in a slow 2 s loop; scale to 1.02 + inner-shadow.

Background: subtle animated grain overlay + soft radial glow behind the image.

CTA button: wiggles or glow-pulses when hovered, with an arrow that darts right.

7. Visual overhaul & animations
Background texture: very subtle noise grain via CSS background-image: url(grain.png) + low opacity.

Section transitions: fade-slide in from bottom (400 ms, custom cubic-bezier).

Bullet hover: left border grows from 0 → 4 px; text colour shifts.

Buttons & links: ripple or inset glow, custom @keyframes for pulse, micro-tilt on hover.

Global variables: centralize durations, easings, radii; swap for reduced-motion.

8. Mobile readiness
Responsive padding: shrink sections to 6 vh top/bottom.

Collapse bullets: accordion-style on ≤ 600 px.

Touch-friendly: 48 px tap targets, remove hover-only effects.

Bottom line: one seamless, single-scroll landing page that reads like a high-impact CV—zero janky jumps, maximum over-the-top CSS/TypeScript motion, killer content bullets, and a “Website Display” card that can’t be missed.
