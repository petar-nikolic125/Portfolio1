Create a single-page personal portfolio that feels like an impeccably printed ivory business card—Timothy Price meets modern UI. Think American Psycho’s debonaire minimalism: sharply-set type, obsessive alignment, rich paper texture translated into pixels, and discreet micro-interactions that whisper class rather than shout.

1 Hero section (fold killer)
Full-viewport height, matte off-white (#F8F8F4) background with a barely visible linen grain.

Center-left column, max-width = 780 px.

Name in 64 px Cormorant Garamond semibold, tracking 0.5 px.

Under it a 28 px Inter Light subtitle (e.g., Software Engineer · F1 Aficionado).

Location row: hairline map-pin icon + small-caps location text.

Two buttons:

“Résumé” – stroked button, 1 px charcoal border, on hover border/fill invert.

“Let’s talk” – solid deep-navy fill (#0C1A25), on hover subtle scale 1.03.

Social icons (LinkedIn, X, GitHub) in a single muted row; monotone outline style that fills on hover.

2 Experience / Education
Toggle pill with glass-morphic backdrop-blur (Modern Mac style).

Horizontal timeline (not vertical like the reference) spanning the full width.

Each stop: company logo in 48 px greyscale circle → slim hairline → details block.

Details block:

Period in 14 px Inter SemiBold small-caps.

Company in 20 px Cormorant bold, role in 16 px Inter Regular muted.

Sub-pixel-perfect baseline grid—no label drifts.

3 Skills strip
Centered heading.

Pills with charcoal text on silken-white background, 4 px radius, slight inner-shadow to evoke letterpress.

On hover each pill lifts 2 px and adds a tiny bottom shadow.

4 Projects gallery
Two-column masonry grid, 32 px gap.

Project card (ratio 4:5):

Full-width edge-to-edge image (auto-darkened 10 %) with elegant 8 px radius.

Below, project name in 22 px Cormorant bold; one-line blurb in 16 px Inter; tech badges as mini pills.

Primary action (“Live Site” / “Source”) as inconspicuous text links that gain underline only on hover.

Subtle card hover: translateY(-6 px) + shadow (0 6 12 rgba 0,0,0,0.08)).

5 Projects index page
Sticky left sidebar (240 px) with accordion filters: Technology, Availability, Type – checkbox list in slender Didot small-caps.

Right pane table:

Columns: Project Name | Tech Stack (badges) | Links (inline icons).

Zebra rows with 3 % charcoal tint.

Global search bar top-center, 48 px height, rounded full.

6 Footer
Centered personal monogram (embossed effect) followed by discrete social row.

Micro-print © line in 12 px Inter Medium uppercase tracking 2.

Motion & polish
All section entries fade-up 20 px over 300 ms with cubic-bezier(.16,.84,.44,1).

Prefers-reduced-motion respected.

Use CSS variables for palette + radius to keep the design system tight.

### 7  Work ⇄ Education section

*Place this block directly under the hero.*

| Requirement    | Spec                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layout         | Same glass-blur toggle pill from §2, but labels **“Work”** / **“Education”**. The inactive side dims to 40 % opacity.                                      |
| Work data      | Single item for now → **“Freelance Web Developer & Contract Work”** / *2022 – present*. 16 px Inter Regular for role, period in 14 px small-caps.          |
| Education data | Single item → **“BSc Computer Science, RAF – Računarski fakultet”** / *2023 – present*.                                                                    |
| Timeline style | Horizontal hairline (1 px, rgba(17,17,17,.08)) with round stops. Stop hover enlarges dot  → reveal tooltip card (white on charcoal) with line-height snap. |
| Micro-motion   | Slide-in of card on toggle (250 ms cubic-bezier(.16,.84,.44,1)).                                                                                           |

### 8  Contact row (future integrations)

*Append at the very bottom of the hero:*

* Four icons, 28 px, equidistant: GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, Mail.
* Greyscale outline; on hover they fill deep-navy and icon lifts 1 px.
* For now use `href="#"`; I’ll wire actual links later.

---

### 9  Project showcase (cards view)

*Follows Skills block.*

1. **Two-column masonry grid** (card width 420 px, gap 32 px).
2. Card anatomy (top-to-bottom):

   * Image 4:5, radius 8 px, darken 10 %.
   * Name (22 px Cormorant bold).
   * One-sentence blurb (16 px Inter).
   * Tech pills (charcoal text on ivory, 4 px radius).
   * Primary action buttons: “Live Site” / “Source Code” as ghost links (no outline until hover).
3. Card hover: translateY(-6 px) and shadow `0 6 12 rgba(0,0,0,.08)`.

Keep typography, palette, and motion exactly as defined in the earlier brief so the whole site continues to feel like that flawless *American Psycho* business card—only now with a crystal-clear résumé timeline and a power-user project finder.
Tech stack mandate (add to the brief)

Build everything in React 18 + TypeScript, scaffolded with Vite, and style exclusively with Tailwind v3 utility classes.

Keep components functional with hooks.

Use folder-by-feature structure (/components, /sections, /pages).

Configure Vite aliases (@/) for clean imports.

No additional CSS files—only Tailwind (extend the theme for the ivory/charcoal palette).

Enable tailwindcss-animate for the subtle motions specified earlier.

That’s the required foundation—everything else from the previous specs stays the same.
